# ProductBarcodes
This is an app to help with products that are missing a barcode on the item, to allow them to easily be scanned. When the app is initially installed, there are no products in the database, but the more the user adds, the more they can use. 

# Code Info
This app was written in java, using android studio. The database uses `SQLite` and the barcode generator uses the `zxing` library.

# Usage
To begin, hit the `+` button. From there a menu will come up prompting the user to enter the name, SKU and console (default is none) of the product. Once products are added to the database, the user may click on any of the products in the list to display the barcode as well as an option to delete the product from the databse.
