# ProductBarcodes
This is an app to help with products that are missing a barcode on the item, to allow them to easily be scanned. When the app is initially installed, there are no products in the database, but the more the user adds, the more they can use. 

# Code Info
This app was written in java, using android studio. The database uses `SQLite` and the barcode generator uses the `zxing` library.
